// ErrDeviceCodeNotFound is returned by a lookup or consume that finds no row

// verification page maps it to a 404 without distinguishing the cases so a
// caller cannot probe which user_codes are in use.

// ErrDuplicateDeviceCode is returned by SaveDeviceCode when a row with the
// same device_code (PK) or user_code (UNIQUE) already exists. It is the
// consumer-side sentinel the /device_authorization handler matches via
// errors.Is so its regeneration loop is decoupled from the concrete store
// type; *sqlite.Store wraps this through its own typed sentinel.
var ErrDuplicateDeviceCode = errors.New("oidc: duplicate device code")

// ErrDeviceCodeNotPending is returned by Approve / Deny when the targeted
// row exists but is no longer in the pending state — its approved_at or
// denied_at is already stamped. The verification handler maps this to the
// same "already decided" response a second click on Approve or an Approve
// after Deny would produce, so the UI cannot be coaxed into flipping a
// decision by re-submitting the form.

// DeviceCode is the per-flow row backing RFC 8628 — OAuth 2.0 Device
// Authorization Grant. It is created when a headless client posts to
// /device_authorization (§3.1), then transitions through pending → approved
// (or denied) as the user completes the verification flow on a second
// device, and is finally consumed by the polling /token call (§3.4) that
// mints the JWT.
//
// Code is the long, machine-side token the polling client presents; UserCode
// is the short, human-typeable token shown on the device and entered on the
// verification page (already normalised — uppercase, no dashes — so a lookup
// is a plain UNIQUE-index probe).
//
// Email is empty until Approve stamps the authenticated user onto the row;
// ApprovedAt and DeniedAt carry the pending → approved/denied transition,
// with both nil meaning "still awaiting user action". LastPolledAt and
// IntervalSeconds back the server-enforced slow_down rule (§3.5): a poll
// arriving sooner than IntervalSeconds since the last one returns slow_down
// and bumps the stored interval by +5.

// device_codes table; declaring them in one place keeps the contract
// discoverable without forcing each child handler to re-declare a near-
