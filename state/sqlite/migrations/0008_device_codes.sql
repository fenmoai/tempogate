-- RFC 8628 §3.1: per-flow row holding the device_code (the long, machine-side
-- token the polling client presents at /token) and the user_code (the short,
-- human-typeable token shown on the device and entered on the verification
-- page). user_code is stored already normalised (uppercase, no dashes) so the
-- verification path's lookup is a plain UNIQUE-index probe rather than a
-- post-hoc fold; the handler is responsible for normalising on the way in.
--
-- approved_at / denied_at carry the pending → approved/denied transition;
-- both NULL means "still awaiting user action on the verification page".
-- last_polled_at + interval_seconds back the server-enforced slow_down logic
-- (§3.5): a poll arriving sooner than interval_seconds since the last one
-- returns slow_down and bumps interval_seconds by +5. Expiry is the handler's
-- concern (it owns the clock); the row is reaped only on consume or by a
-- sweeper, mirroring auth_codes / refresh_tokens.
