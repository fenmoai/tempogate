-- First-party browser session table for the device-flow verification UI.
-- sid is an opaque 32-byte random value (base64url) carried in a signed
-- HttpOnly cookie scoped to the verification pages; the cookie's signature
-- protects integrity, this row binds it to the authenticated email and an
-- absolute expiry. TTL enforcement is the handler's concern (it owns the
-- clock); the row survives until consume / forced revocation / expiry sweep.
